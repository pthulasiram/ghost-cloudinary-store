**DEPRECATED**
As the referenced repo on the Ghost Documentation is pointing to this [repo](https://github.com/mmornati/ghost-cloudinary-store) and as I'm maintaining both 2 repo with the same code. I decided to go ahead using and upgrading only the other one.
For an issue, update, ... you can go here: https://github.com/mmornati/ghost-cloudinary-store
